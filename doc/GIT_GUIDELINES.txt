*Messages should contain subject and body
*Use a blank linke to separate subject from body
*Rigth on the imperative: "Ads file..." , "Implement functionality...", "Fix bug..."
*Use the body of the message to describe what and why, instead of how
*Describe code limitations
*Use a dot in the end of the message, but not to end the subject
*Refer to issue track number in the commit subject
*Use capital letter in the beginning of subject and body paragraph
